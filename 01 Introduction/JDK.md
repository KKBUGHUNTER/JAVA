1. **Java Compiler (`javac`)**: The JDK includes the Java compiler (`javac`) that translates Java source code into bytecode, which is platform-independent and executable on any system with the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

2. **Java Runtime Environment (JRE)**: Within the JDK, there's a full Java Runtime Environment that includes the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) responsible for executing Java bytecode.

3. **Java API Libraries**: The JDK provides an extensive set of libraries, APIs (Application Programming Interfaces), and frameworks that developers use to build applications. These libraries cover a wide range of functionalities, such as networking, file I/O, data structures, and much more.

4. **Development Tools**: JDK contains various development tools like debuggers, profilers, and documentation generators that assist in writing, testing, and debugging Java programs.

5. **Additional Resources**: It also includes other resources like sample code, demos, and documentation to help developers learn and utilize Java effectively.
