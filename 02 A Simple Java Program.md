# A Simple Java Program
```java
public class SimpleJavaProgram{
	public static void main(String[] args){
		System.out.println("Hello World!...");
	}
}
```
let's break down the parts of this simple Java program:

1. **public class SimpleJavaProgram**: 
    - `public` is an access modifier meaning this class is accessible to other classes.
    - `class` keyword defines a class in Java.
    - `SimpleJavaProgram` is the name of the class.

2. **public static void main(String[] args)**:
    - `public static` indicates that the method can be called from outside the class and it belongs to the class itself, not to any instance.
    - `void` means the method does not return any value.
    - `main` is the method name.
    - `String[] args` is the parameter the `main` method takes, which is an array of strings typically used to pass command-line arguments.

3. **System.out.println("Hello World!...")**:
    - `System` is a class in Java's standard library.
    - `out` is a static member of the `System` class representing the standard output stream.
    - `println` is a method used to print a line to the standard output.
    - `"Hello World!..."` is the string being printed.

This program essentially defines a class named `SimpleJavaProgram` containing a `main` method. When executed, it prints "Hello World!..." to the console.

## To run a Java file, follow these steps:

1. **Write the Java code**: Create a Java file with a `.java` extension. save the code with the `same class name which contains the main method` in your Code.

2. **Compile the Java file**: Open a command prompt or terminal, navigate to the directory where your Java file is located, and use the `javac` command to compile the Java source code. For example:
    ```
    javac SimpleJavaProgram.java
    ```
    This will create a `.class` file containing bytecode.

3. **Run the compiled Java program**: After successful compilation, use the `java` command followed by the name of the class containing the `main` method (without the `.class` extension). For example:
    ```
    java SimpleJavaProgram
    ```
    This command executes the bytecode generated from your Java source code.
